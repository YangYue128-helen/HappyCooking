Motivation
It was dinner time. 
“What should I have for dinner?” 
Opening the fridge, I saw all kinds of vegetables, and nothing came to mind. I ended up ordering delivery. 

It was dinner time. 
“What should I have for dinner?”
Opening the fridge, I saw tomatoes, eggs, some capsicums. I had stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs. Even though I wanted to try something else, it is the only thing I know out of tomatoes and eggs. 

It was dinner time. 
“What should I have for dinner?”
I was excited that I found a great recipe online until I opened fridge. I do not have what I need. 

It was dinner time. 
“What should I have for dinner?”
I came up with a new dish with what I have in the fridge, and it tasted great!
“Oh, I wish someone else can try this as well!” 

If you are a person like me, you must have encountered one of the situations above. To solve such problems, we are keen to develop an app, a platform where those who are good chefs can upload their recipes, those who want to learn cooking can find tasty recipes, and those who are stuck with the ingredients in the fridge and make some good dishes out of it.

Aim
We hope to allow users to access a collection of classified recipes and provide a very easy way to search (both by filter and keywords of the ingredients).

User Stories
1. As a housewife, families always complain about having the same dishes every day, but I am running out of my skills. I do not really know what else can cook using the ingredients in the fridge. At this moment, this app saves me. I can just type in the name of ingredients. Or simply take a photo of all the things in the fridge and all the ingredients I have are automatically recognized. All matching recipes would pop up. 
2. As a novice at cooking, the detail pages of the recipes provide me with a comprehensive guide on cooking. Not just text, but with voice guides and even augmented reality. Simply point the camera at my ingredients or whichever step that I am at, instructions would pop up in the air and show me what to do. 
3. As a chef who wants to bring good recipes to more people, I can share my recipes on this platform. 
4. As a user who wants to share the process of cooking or the final looks of their dishes, I can post via text, pictures, or videos and receive comments from others. These posts can be a reference for others who are trying to use the same recipe as well. 

Features 
1. The Introduction Page is a welcome page when the user opens the app every time. It has some nice food picture and a pleasing sentence.
2. The Moment Page allows users to post pictures or videos. This page shows posts of all the users where the user can leave comments and click “like” button to like the post. 
● In the posting page, the user is allowed to choose to take a picture/video with the system camera or choose one or more picture/video from the photo albums. A caption can be added. If the posting picture is related to any recipe that exists in the recipe database, the use can choose a recipe as a tag.
3. The Recipe Page can switch between “Recommended” page and “All” page.
● When clicking the “Recommended” icon, the recommended recipe list shows up.
● When clicking the “All” icon, all the recipes are listed on the screen. The user can search through all the recipes by both filter and keywords. Uploading recipe is allowed as well.
● When clicking on a recipe, recipe details page will show up containing the picture of the final dish by the creator, name of the recipe, creator of the recipe, ratings by other users, picture/video posted with this recipe tag, as well as comments.
4. The Me Page stores the post history of the user and the recipe created by the use if any. It records all the posts that the user posted in the past.
5. Implement machine learning to recommend recipes to the user’s taste.
6. Implement graphic recognition that identifies the ingredients in the fridge where the user’s camera is pointing.

Functional prototype:
Login and signup. Users are able to log in and signup for the app with their email address and password.
Moment page: Users can click on the bottom tab ‘moment’ and view the posts on this page. However, the function of posting is currently not available, which will be done in the next phase.
Recipe page: Users can click on the bottom tab ‘recipe’ and see two tabs show up which are the “All” tab and “Recommended” tab. Recipes are listed here. Users can click on each recipe card and view the recipe details including the ingredients and steps.
Searching feature: Users can find a search bar on the recipe page. The searching feature is currently fetching the name of the cuisine. In the next phase, this feature will be extended to searching for ingredients.
Sign out and switch account: users can click on the setting button located at the profile page and logout from the account they are currently using.
